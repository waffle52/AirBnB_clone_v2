## models/engine/file_storage.py, models/engine/db_storage.py, models/state.py
Before using Flask to display our HBNB data, you will need to update some part of our engine:
Update FileStorage: (models/engine/file_storage.py)
Add a public method def close(self):: call reload() method for deserializing the JSON file to objects
Update DBStorage: (models/engine/db_storage.py)
Add a public method def close(self):: call remove() method on the private session attribute (self.__session) tips or close() on the class Session tips
Update State: (models/state.py) - If it’s not already present
If your storage engine is not DBStorage, add a public getter method cities to return the list of City objects from storage linked to the current State
## web_flask/7-states_list.py, web_flask/templates/7-states_list.html
Write a script that starts a Flask web application:
Your web application must be listening on 0.0.0.0, port 5000
You must use storage for fetching data from the storage engine (FileStorage or DBStorage) => from models import storage and storage.all(...)
After each request you must remove the current SQLAlchemy Session:
Declare a method to handle @app.teardown_appcontext
Call in this method storage.close()
Routes:
/states_list: display a HTML page: (inside the tag BODY)
H1 tag: “States”
UL tag: with the list of all State objects present in DBStorage sorted by name (A->Z) tip
LI tag: description of one State: <state.id>: <B><state.name></B>
Import this 7-dump to have some data
You must use the option strict_slashes=False in your route definition

You must use storage for fetching data from the storage engine (FileStorage or DBStorage) => from models import storage and storage.all(...)
To load all cities of a State:
If your storage engine is DBStorage, you must use cities relationship
Otherwise, use the public getter method cities
After each request you must remove the current SQLAlchemy Session:

/states/<id>: display a HTML page: (inside the tag BODY)
If a State object is found with this id:
H1 tag: “State: ”
H3 tag: “Cities:”
UL tag: with the list of City objects linked to the State sorted by name (A->Z)
LI tag: description of one City: <city.id>: <B><city.name></B>
Otherwise:
H1 tag: “Not found!”
You must use the option strict_slashes=False in your route definition

## web_flask/10-hbnb_filters.py, web_flask/templates/10-hbnb_filters.html, web_flask/static/
Write a script that starts a Flask web application:
Your web application must be listening on 0.0.0.0, port 5000
You must use storage for fetching data from the storage engine (FileStorage or DBStorage) => from models import storage and storage.all(...)
